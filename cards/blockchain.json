    "short_answer": "A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions in blocks linked by cryptographic hashes, making tampering difficult without network consensus.",
    "kid_friendly": "A blockchain is like a shared notebook where many computers agree on each page, so nobody can secretly change what was written before.",
    "standard": "Blockchain technology organizes data into sequential blocks secured by cryptographic hashes and validated through consensus mechanisms (proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, etc.). It enables decentralized record keeping for cryptocurrencies and other applications that require audit trails without a central authority.",
    "expert_notes": "Discuss trade-offs among consensus algorithms, scalability limits (throughput, latency), smart contracts, and regulatory considerations."

  "slots": {
    "definition": "A distributed ledger structure that stores ordered records across a peer-to-peer network, using consensus to validate new entries.",
    "key_characteristics": [
      "Data grouped into blocks with cryptographic hashes referencing prior blocks",
      "Consensus protocols coordinate validation among nodes",
      "Immutability is probabilistic, depending on honest majority assumptions",
