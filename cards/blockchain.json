    "short_answer": "A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions in blocks linked by cryptographic hashes, making tampering difficult without network consensus.",
    "kid_friendly": "A blockchain is like a shared notebook where many computers agree on each page, so nobody can secretly change what was written before.",
    "standard": "Blockchain technology organizes data into sequential blocks secured by cryptographic hashes and validated through consensus mechanisms (proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, etc.). It enables decentralized record keeping for cryptocurrencies and other applications that require audit trails without a central authority.",
    "expert_notes": "Discuss trade-offs among consensus algorithms, scalability limits (throughput, latency), smart contracts, and regulatory considerations."

  "slots": {
    "definition": "A distributed ledger structure that stores ordered records across a peer-to-peer network, using consensus to validate new entries.",
    "key_characteristics": [
      "Data grouped into blocks with cryptographic hashes referencing prior blocks",
      "Consensus protocols coordinate validation among nodes",
      "Immutability is probabilistic, depending on honest majority assumptions",
      "Often paired with smart contract execution environments"
    ],
    "applications": [
      "Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum)",
