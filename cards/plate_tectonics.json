    "short_answer": "Plate tectonics describes how Earth's lithosphere is divided into plates that move over the mantle, driving earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain building.",
    "kid_friendly": "Earth's crust is broken into giant puzzle pieces that slowly slide around, making mountains and causing earthquakes.",
    "standard": "Plate tectonics is the geologic theory that the lithosphere consists of interacting plates propelled by mantle convection. Their motion creates divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries responsible for seafloor spreading, subduction, volcanism, and orogeny.",
    "expert_notes": "Mention seafloor spreading evidence, hotspot reference frames, GPS velocity data, and slab-pull/ridge-push forces."
