    "short_answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in sugars.",
    "kid_friendly": "Photosynthesis lets plants use sunlight, air, and water to make their own food and release oxygen for us to breathe.",
    "standard": "Photosynthesis is a biochemical process in which light-harvesting pigments capture photons to drive reactions that split water, fix carbon dioxide via the Calvin cycle, and produce carbohydrates and oxygen. It underpins most food chains and global oxygen supply.",
    "expert_notes": "Mention PSI/PSII dynamics, electron transport chains, rubisco limitations, and the difference between C3, C4, and CAM pathways."

    "definition": "A light-dependent metabolic pathway that converts solar energy into chemical energy by fixing carbon dioxide and splitting water, releasing oxygen as a byproduct.",
    "key_characteristics": [
      "Occurs in chloroplast thylakoid membranes (light reactions) and stroma (Calvin cycle)",
