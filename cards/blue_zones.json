    "standard": "Blue Zones refer to geographic areas identified by Dan Buettner and colleagues where residents appear to reach age 90 or 100 at higher-than-average rates. Proposed contributors include plant-forward diets, daily low-intensity activity, community support, and limited smoking, though data quality has been debated.",
