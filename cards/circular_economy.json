    "short_answer": "A circular economy is an industrial system designed to minimize waste and keep materials in use through reuse, repair, remanufacture, and recycling.",
    "kid_friendly": "In a circular economy, people try to make things last longer by fixing, sharing, and recycling instead of throwing them away.",
    "standard": "The circular economy framework seeks to decouple growth from resource use by designing products for durability, maximizing reuse loops, and recovering nutrients and materials at end-of-life. It blends industrial ecology principles with policy tools such as extended producer responsibility.",
    "expert_notes": "Include Ellen MacArthur Foundation's butterfly diagram, EU Circular Economy Action Plan, metrics (material circularity indicator), and critiques about rebound effects."
